# gmc_scrape
This is a Python project with the goal of using BeautifulSoup library to scrape basketball statistics from <a href="gmcsports.com">Greater Miami Conference</a> and calculate some "advanced metrics."

A Tableau dashboard accompanies this dataset and can be found here.

Definitions for advanced metrics are based on <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html">Basketball-Reference.com</a>
